## Setup for Local Development
Project setup following [this guide](https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-backend/)
### Installing and running the repository
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/okputadora/neighbors.git`
1. `npm install`
1. `$ nodemon`
1. Open a new terminal and `$ cd client`
1. `$ npm start`
### Database setup
1. in the root directory create a .env file and intialize a variable called `MONGO_URI`
1. create a mongo database in your local environment and point the MONGO_URI to it
1. from the root directory import the phillyhoods data into your db

## Technologies used
* This project was built using MySql + sequelize, MongoDB, Node, Express, React, and Redux.
* Additional technologies include react-router(v4), google maps and places APIs,
data from [philly-hoods](http://phillyhoods.net/) (to get neighborhood boundaries), and
[socket.io](https://socket.io/) for live chat functionality.

## Project structure
* The server-side code is the main directory and runs on PORT 3001
* All of the front-end React code lives in the client directory and runs on PORT 3000
* The projects are connected via the package.json file in the client directory
* `"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"`

### A Note on the Database(s)
This project utilizes and MySql database and a Mongo database. Why both you may ask?
Well, we started with a MySql database to handle all of the user, location, and message
storage because this was one of the assignment requirements. While we were building
the neighborhood outline functionality it became clear that we would need this
information in a database as there was no viable API to fetch this information.
The [philly-hoods](http://phillyhoods.net/) API has been down for some time, but
they do have a JSON file in their repo with the necessary coordinates. The problem
is that the data is structured like this...
`"name" : "Washington Square West",
        "totalStreets" : 0,
        "geometry" : {
            "type" : "Polygon",
            "coordinates" : [[[-75.157058, 39.942596], [-75.157571, 39.942665]...
`

The coordinates data that we need is stored as an array of an array of arrays, and while
it's certainly possible to arrange this data in a relational way, using a non-relation method
is much, much, much...much easier.

### Server Side
The server side code was bootstrapped with [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator)
The server structure is as follows:
1. __api route__
  1. There is a single api route for handling all of our resources. The way this works
  is by passing the resource name in the request. The API route then calls the
  appropriate controller based on the resource name
  1. For example, a basic get route looks like this:
  `router.get('/:resource', function(req, res, next){
  	var resource = req.params.resource;
  	var controller = controllers[resource];
  	if (controller == null){
  		res.json({
  			confirmation:'fail',
  			message:'Invalid resource...check your spelling'
  		})
  	}
  	controller.get(req.query)
  	.then(function(results){
  		res.json({
  	    confirmation: 'success',
  	    results: results
  	  })
  	})
  	.catch(function(err){
  		res.json({
  			confirmation: 'fail',
  			errorMessage: err
  		})
  	})
  })`

  if we want to get all of the messages for a given location we would provide the
  name of the resource (i.e. message) and then specify which location in req.query

  and if we want to get all of the users in a given location we still hit the same route
  but pass the user resource instead of message.   

  1. __controllers__
  1. __models__

### Client Side
* The client side code was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The webpack configuration was upgraded to allow styling with css modules
The frontend react code (in the src directory) is structured as follows:

1. __store:__ the store directory holds all of the redux code. Right now redux
is mainly used for handling user login so that their location (i.e. neighborhood)
and profile details can be shared easily throughout the application. While it might
make sense to handle that chatbox state with redux (for a single source of truth),
because the chat history does not need to be accessible anywhere but the chatbox,
we have opted to keep this state local and handle it with a pure react solution
1. __containers:__ this directory holds the three large containers for the project
  1. The layout component dictates the overall structure of the page and loads
  in the other components as necessary
  1. The login component is rendered on the index route and connects to the
  redux store set the location and active user in the global state. N.B. it
  is important that this state is note stored locally to the login component
  because we will need to access it from the chat component
  1. After the user logs in, the chat room component is rendered within the layout component.
  This chat room component renders a map component and the chatbox component
1. __components:__ the components directory holds the map and chat box components
as well as some UI components.
  1. The map component...
  1. The chat box component loads messages associated with the current location
  from the backend in the `componentWillMount()` lifecycle method. These messages
  are then stored in this components local state.
1. __utils:__ the utils directory includes two libraries for making API calls to
the server and the google maps/places/geoCoder API

## Additional Notes
## Todo
1. Make the chat "live" with socket.io?
1. Mobile/Responsive design
1. Place pins on the map for each active person ?? actually, is this desirable?
1. Profile page? About page? Welcome Page
1. Delay page load until image loads
1. Avatars in the chat
1. Add event handler to chatbox to submit message on Enter keypress
1. Set focus on input fields with ref()
1. Encrypt password with bcrypt
1. ~~show timestamp in chat~~
1. Persist Redux State

## Bugs
1. when you navigate back to the login screen after successfully logging in
you are automatically redirected back to the chatroom as soon as you start typing something
-- this is probably because the state is set to loggedIn on the first login and doesn't
set to logged out when the user goes back --- what do we want this UX to look like,
should they get logged out?
